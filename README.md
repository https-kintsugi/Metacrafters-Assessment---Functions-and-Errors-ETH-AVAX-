# Function And Errors
The project aims to showcase the student's fundamental understanding of error handling in Solidity programming.

## Description

This code will accept a value that does not equate to zero, is not lower the initial value, or exceed the maximum set value. The purpose is to demonstrate the knowledge of the student in error handling, complete with explanation and code walkthrough, to assess the student's skill in this level of Solidity programming. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with your name of choice and a .sol extension.

### Executing program

* Compile the program by pressing (ctrl + s) or click the compile button from the top left side of the screen.
* Deploy the smart contract under the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.
